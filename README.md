## Examples

Is this your first time using AngularDart?

* Start with a [tutorial][tutorial] to build a fully working application,
  including routing, HTTP networking, and more.

* Next, try a [code-lab on writing material design applications][code_lab],
  which uses the [`angular_components`](https://webdev.dartlang.org/components)
  package for production-quality material design widgets built and used by
  Google.

You may also be interested in a set of [community contributed tutorials][comm].

## Installation

AngularDart is available as the `angular2` package on [pub][]. We recommend
following our [tutorial][] to get started.

> For historic reasons, this package is called `angular2`, instead of an older
> implementation called `angular`. We hope to rename this package to avoid
> confusion in the near future - [track our progress][track_rename].

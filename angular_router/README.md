The [AngularDart][webdev_angular] router enables navigation from one view to
the next as users perform application tasks.

The 1.0 version of `angular_router` is just a port of the router that was in
the core `angular` package. Only critical bug fixes are planned for the 1.0
router. A significant refactoring is in progress, which is expected to result
in a 2.0 version of `angular_router`.

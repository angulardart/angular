The Angular Router enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform
application tasks.

This is initially just a port of the router that was in the core angular
package. However, we do have a significant refactoring in progress that will
result in `angular_router` `2.0.0`. As such, we are not planning any
non-critical fixes or changes for `1.0`

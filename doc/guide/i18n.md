# Internationalization (i18n)


AngularDart supports internationalization directly in templates via integration
with [package:intl][intl].

[intl]: https://pub.dev/packages/intl

## Overview

A document fragment can be marked for internationalization by applying an
`@i18n` annotation to its parent element:

```dart
<div @i18n="A description of the message for translators.">
  The message to be translated, potentially containing <b>nested</b> markup.
</div>
```

Note that `<ng-container>` can be used to host an `@i18n` annotation to avoid
introducing another element just for the sake of internationalization:

```dart
<ng-container @i18n="A description of the message for translators.">
  The message to be translated, potentially containing <b>nested</b> markup.
</ng-container>
```

An attribute or property can be marked for internationalization by applying an
`@i18n:<name>` annotation to the same element.

```dart
<input
    type="text"
    placeholder="The message to be translated."
    @i18n:placeholder="A description of the message for translators.">
```

## Syntax

### Annotations

Each annotation directly corresponds to an `Intl.message()` parameter.

#### `@i18n`

The value of this annotation sets the message [description][description] for
translators. This is _required_ to mark a message for internationalization.

#### `@i18n.meaning`

The value of this annotation sets the [meaning][meaning] parameter, which is
used to disambiguate identical messages with different meanings.

**NOTE:** A different description is not sufficient to differentiate two
identical messages.

Without unique meanings, two identical messages will be treated as the same,
potentially resulting in an incorrect translation for one.

```dart
<div
    @i18n="A description of the message for translators."
    @i18n.meaning="A machine used to lift things.">
  Crane
</div>

<div
    @i18n="A description of the message for translators."
    @i18n.meaning="A large, long-legged and long-necked bird.">
  Crane
</div>

```

#### `@i18n.skip`

The presence of this annotation sets the [skip][skip] parameter to true, which
prevents it from being extracted for translation. This is useful to avoid
translating a message that hasn't been finalized yet.

```dart
<img
    src="puppy.png"
    alt="This message is a draft that shouldn't be translated yet."
    @i18n:alt="A description of the message for translators."
    @i18n.skip:alt>
```

#### `@i18n.locale`

The value of this annotation sets the locale parameter, which forces that locale
to be used for translating this message. This is useful when translations are
available or in progress, but not intended to be used yet.

```dart
<div
    @i18n="A description of the message for translators."
    @i18n.locale="en">
  The message to be translated.
</div>
```

[locale]: https://pub.dev/documentation/intl/latest/intl/Intl/message.html

### Internationalizing text and HTML

By default, all internationalization annotations apply to the content within the
element. This content (a document fragment) may consist of text nodes and
HTML elements.

```dart {.no-copy}
<div
    @i18n="A description."
    @i18n.meaning="A meaning."
    @i18n.locale="en"
    @i18n.skip>
  A message with <span class="fancy">HTML</span>.
</div>
```

### Internationalizing attributes

To internationalize an attribute or property, append `:<name>` to the
annotation.

```dart {.no-copy}
<h1
    title="A message."
    @i18n:title="A description."
    @i18n.meaning:title="A meaning."
    @i18n.locale:title="en"
    @i18n.skip:title>
  Title
</h1>
```

## Extraction

For each unique `@i18n` message in a component template, the AngularDart
compiler generates an `Intl.message()` in the corresponding `.template.dart`
file. To ensure these messages are extracted for translation, make sure your
application includes the `intl` generator in its top-level Dart binary or
library. For more information, see [extracting messages and generating
code][extraction].

## Limitations

### Static text and HTML only

The contents of an `@i18n` message may only consist of static text and HTML.
Interpolations, references, directives, and bindings of any kind are not yet
supported (note this excludes the host element). Continue to use
`Intl.message()` imperatively for messages with arguments.

### No support for `Intl.gender()` or `Intl.plural()`

There's no dedicated template syntax for handling these methods yet. Continue to
use these methods imperatively.

### Locale must be initialized before components

The locale of an `@i18n` message is finalized once rendered. Thus it's important
to [await locale initialization][initialization] before running your app.
Consequently, changing the locale after initialization requires a full app
reload.

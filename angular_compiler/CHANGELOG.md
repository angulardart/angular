* `ModuleReader.deduplicateProviders` now returns a `List` not a `Set`, and
  providers that are _multi_ are not removed, as it is a feature of the DI
  system to have multiple of them with the same token.
  
* Add the `TypeLink` class.

## 0.4.0-alpha+3

* Added support for recognizing the `MultiToken` type.

## 0.4.0-alpha+2

* `CompilerFlags` now supports as a `fast_boot` argument; default is `true`.
* `ReflectorEmitter` now takes an optional `deferredModules{Source}`.

## 0.4.0-alpha+1

* Now using `code_builder: '>=2.0.0-beta <3.0.0'`.

### Bug Fixes

* Correctly depend on `analyzer: ^0.31.0-alpha.1`.

## 0.4.0-alpha

While _technically_ a breaking change from `0.3.0`, it will likely be safe for
most users to set bound constraints that include `0.4.0`; this will allow users
of the `4.0.0` AngularDart release to utilize the new `generator_inputs`
optimization.

```yaml
dependencies:
  angular_compiler: '>=0.3.0 <0.5.0'
```

### Breaking changes

* `@Component` and `@Directive` annotated classes are no longer `@Injectable`.
  In practice this means they can no loger be provided as an implicit
  `const Provider(FooComponent)` without either manually adding `@Injectable`
  or refactoring your code. We found this didn't really affect users, and most
  uses of components and directives in these lists were accidental.

### New features

* Add `generator_inputs` flag support to `CompilerFlags`, to speed up builds
  that use `barback` (i.e. pub transformers). By default in `pub` it assumed
  that all files relative to the same package have the AngularDart transformer
  run on them:

```
lib/
  foo.dart
  bar.dart
```

This used to asynchronously block and wait for generation to complete, but at
`0.3.1` will instead infer that a relative import _will_ eventually have a
generated file:

```dart
// foo.dart
import 'bar.dart';
```

While this could be considered a **breaking change**, in practice it should be
breaking only if the `$include` or `$exclude` flags are being used to control
what files have the AngularDart generator run on them. In that case, the flag
can be controlled:

```yaml
transformers:
  - angular:
      $include:
        - lib/foo.dart
      generator_inputs:
        - lib/foo.dart      # Only foo.dart, not bar.dart.
        - lib/src/**.dart   # But include everything else.
```

* Started adding experimental support for a new `Module` syntax.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug in the _outliner_ that did not the correct output extension.

## 0.3.0

- Always link to `export "...template.dart" files` in `initReflector()`.
- Catch missing field-formal (`this.`) fields and warn in the compiler.
- Does not emit a `registerDependencies` function call for empty constructors.
- `initReflector()` no longer treats `@Pipe` as an `@Injectable` service.

## 0.2.2

- Fixed the outliner to instruct the analyzer to ignore unused imports.
- Add `NgAssetReader`.

## 0.2.1

- Various changes internal to the compiler.

## 0.2.0

- Added various classes and helpers to form the new compile infrastructure:
  - `ComponentReader`
  - `DependencyReader`, `DependencyInvocation`, `DependencyElement`
  - `ProviderReader`, `ProviderElement`
  - `TokenReader`, `TypeTokenElement`, `OpaqueTokenElement`
  - `getInheritanceHierarchy`, `urlOf`
  - `ReflectableReader`, `ReflectableOutput`, `ReflectableClass`

## 0.1.1

- Fixed a bug where flag `entry_points` was only allowed to be a list.

## 0.1.0

- Initial commit of `angular_compiler`.

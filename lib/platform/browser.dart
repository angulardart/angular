/// Bootstrapping for Angular applications.
///
/// You instantiate an Angular application by explicitly specifying a component
/// to use as the root component for your application via the [bootstrap]
/// method.
///
/// An application is bootstrapped inside an existing browser DOM, typically
/// `index.html`. Unlike Angular 1, Angular 2 does not compile/process providers
/// in index.html. This is mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural
/// changes in Angular 2. This means that `index.html` can safely be processed
/// using server-side technologies such as providers. Bindings can thus use
/// double-curly syntax, `{{...}}`, without collision with Angular 2
/// `{{...}}` template syntax.
///
/// When an app developer invokes [bootstrap] with a root component
/// as its argument, Angular performs the following tasks:
///
///  1. It uses the component's [selector] property to locate the DOM element
///     which needs to be upgraded into the angular component.
///  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector).
///     Optionally, you can also override the injector configuration for an app
///     by invoking [bootstrap] with the [componentInjectableBindings] argument.
///  3. It creates a new [Zone] and connects it to the angular application's
///     change detection domain instance.
///  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host
///     element and loads the template into it.
///  5. It instantiates the specified component.
///  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data
///     providers for the application.
///
/// ### Bootstrapping Multiple Applications
///
/// When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources:
/// cookies, title, location, and others. Angular services that represent these
/// resources must likewise be shared across all Angular applications that
/// occupy the same browser window. For this reason, Angular creates exactly
/// one global platform object which stores all shared services, and each
/// angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.
///
/// Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are
/// multiple applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's
/// services as private to that application.
///

///
/// ### API
///
/// - [appComponentType]: The root component which should act as the
///   application. This is a reference to a [Type] which is annotated with
///   `@Component`.
/// - [customProviders]: An additional set of providers that can be added to the
///   app injector to override default injection behavior.
///
/// Returns a [Future] of [ComponentRef].

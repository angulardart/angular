// This module is used for handling user input, by defining and building a
// [ControlGroup] that consists of [Control] objects, and mapping them onto
// the DOM. [Control] objects can then be used to read information from the
// form DOM elements.
//
// This module is not included in the `angular2` module; you must import the
// forms module explicitly.

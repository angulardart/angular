/**
 * This class should not be used directly by an application developer. Instead, use
 * [Location].
 *
 * `PlatformLocation` encapsulates all calls to DOM apis, which allows the Router to be platform
 * agnostic.
 * This means that we can have different implementation of `PlatformLocation` for the different
 * platforms
 * that angular supports. For example, the default `PlatformLocation` is {@link
 * BrowserPlatformLocation},
 * however when you run your app in a WebWorker you use [WebWorkerPlatformLocation].
 *
 * The `PlatformLocation` class is used directly by all implementations of [LocationStrategy]
 * when
 * they need to interact with the DOM apis like pushState, popState, etc...
 *
 * [LocationStrategy] in turn is used by the [Location] service which is used directly
 * by
 * the [Router] in order to navigate between routes. Since all interactions between {@link
 * Router} /
 * [Location] / [LocationStrategy] and DOM apis flow through the `PlatformLocation`
 * class
 * they are all platform independent.

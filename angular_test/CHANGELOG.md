-   Use the new generic function syntax, stop using `package:func`.

## 1.0.2-alpha

-   Support breaking changes in angular 5.0.0-alpha

## 1.0.1

### Cleanup

-   Remove dependency on `angular_router`.

## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes & Deprecations

-   Throws in bootstrapping if the root component does not use default change
    detection. AngularDart does not support `OnPush` or other change detection
    strategies on the root component.

-   Pub serve now defaults to a random unused port (instead of `8080`) and
    `--port` is deprecated. Going forward the supported way to supply this
    argument is via `--serve-arg`:

```bash
$ pub run angular_test --serve-arg=port=1234
```

-   Option `--run-test-flag` (`-t`) is now **deprecated**, and no longer has a
    default value of `aot`. Tags are still highly encouraged in order to have
    faster compilation times! Use `--test-arg` instead:

```bash
$ pub run angular_test --test-arg=--tags=aot
```

-   Option `--platform` (`-p`) is now **Deprecated**, and no longer has a
    default value of `content-shell`, which was not always installed on host
    machines. Instead use `--test-arg`:

```bash
$ pub run angular_test --test-arg=--platform=content-shell
```

-   Option `--name` (`-n`) and `--simple-name` (`-N`) are also deprecated. Use
    `--test-arg=--name=` and `--test-arg=--simple-name=` instead.

-   Changes to `compatibility.dart` might not be considered in future semver
    updates, and it **highly suggested** you don't use these APIs for any new
    code.

-   Change `NgTestFixture.update` to have a single optional parameter

### Features

-   Add assertOnlyInstance to fixture to remove some boilerplate around testing
    the state of a instance. Only use to test state, not to update it.

-   Added `--serve-arg` and `--test-arg`, which both support multiple arguments
    in order to have better long-term support for proxying to both `pub serve`
    and `pub run test` without frequent changes to this package. For example to
    use the [DartDevCompiler (dartdevc)]:

```bash
$ pub run angular_test --serve-arg=web-compiler=dartdevc
```

-   Add support for setting a custom `PageLoader` factory:

```dart
testBed = testBed.setPageLoader(
  (element) => new CustomPageLoader(...),
);
```

-   Add support for `query` and `queryAll` to `NgTestFixture`. This works
    similar to the `update` command, but is called back with either a single or
    multiple _child_ component instances to interact with or run expectations
    against:

```dart
// Assert we have 3 instances of <child>.
await fixture.queryAll(
  (el) => el.componentInstance is ChildComponent,
  (children) {
    expect(children, hasLength(3));
  },
);
```

-   Add built-in support for `package:pageloader`:

```dart
final fixture = await new NgTestBed<TestComponent>().create();
final pageObject = await fixture.getPageObject/*<ClickCounterPO>*/(
  ClickCounterPO,
);
expect(await pageObject.button.visibleText, 'Click count: 0');
await pageObject.button.click();
expect(await pageObject.button.visibleText, 'Click count: 1');
```

### Fixes

-   Workaround for `pub {serve|build}` hanging on `angular_test` as a
    dependency.

-   Fixes a bug where the root was not removed from the DOM after disposed.

-   Added a missing dependency on `package:func`.

-   Properly fix support for windows by using `pub.bat`.

-   Replace all uses of generic comment with proper syntax.

-   Fixed a bug where `activeTest` was never set (and therefore disposed).

-   Fixed a bug where `pub`, not `pub.bat`, is run in windows.

-   Update `pubspec.yaml` so it properly lists AngularDart `3.0.0-alpha`

-   Fix the executable so `pub run angular_test` can be used

-   Fix a serious generic type error when `NgTestBed` is forked

-   Fix a generic type error

-   Added `compatibility.dart`, a temporary API to some users migrate

transformers:
  # This using the AngularDart transformer causes hanging builds for some
  # clients (https://github.com/dart-lang/angular/issues/549). As it was
  # only needed for a single class, the code was modified temporarily to
  # not need this.
  - angular:
      entry_points: test/**_test.dart
      # Forces this transformer to run somewhat like a "dev-transformer", in
      # that it only executes when you "pub serve" this package directly.

        - test/**_test.dart

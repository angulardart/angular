Thank you for taking the time to file an issue!

In order to route, prioritize, and act on this as soon as possible please include:

* [ ] Dart SDK Version (`dart --version`)
* [ ] AngularDart Version (i.e. `4.0.0`, `5.0.0-alpha+5`, `MASTER`)
* [ ] Whether you are using Windows, macOS, or Linux (if applicable)
* [ ] Whether you are using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (if applicable)
* [ ] Any other packages or constraints we should know about

Missing some or all of the above might make the issue take longer or be impossible to act on.
